## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcelo Robert, and here are a couple of things about me:

I'm currently working as a developer at [ProFUSION](https://github.com/profusion), being part of the [KernelCI Dashboard](https://github.com/kernelci/dashboard) developer team. My current work focuses on frontend development with React + Typescript and backend development with Django (Python).

I am also a Computer Science student at UNIFEI - Universidade Federal de ItajubÃ¡ (Federal University of ItajubÃ¡), having worked on projects such as the development of an app for the mobility of visually impaired people, where I worked on the frontend development with Flutter and made decisions about the features that would be added.

Other projects at UNIFEI include:
- Making a portfolio website using Next.JS;
- Making a hydroponic garden app that communicates with a backend receiving data from a microcontroler using Flutter and message queueing;
- The conception phase for a ride sharing startup, making the initial research and a web landing page using Next.JS and Google Maps API;
- Helping other students as a assistant for Programming Fundamentals classes;
- Making initial projetcs using C.


Other than that, I also like Blender 3D modelling, especially geometry nodes and simple modelling/shading. I am also interested in 3D reconstruction, NeRFs and Gaussian Splatting.

Big fan of Celeste and Terraria, but I'm not much of a competitive gamer though.
